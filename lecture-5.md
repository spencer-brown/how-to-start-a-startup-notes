# Competition is for Losers

### Capturing Value
* A business creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of X.
* X and Y are independent variables.

### Big Piece of a Small Pie
* Airlines: $195.6B revenue, .2% profit margin, $112,4B market capitalization
* Google: $50.2B revenue, 21.0% profit margin, $393.8B market capitalization

### Perfect Competition
* Pros
  * Easy to model
  * Efficient in a static world
  * Politically salable
* Cons
  * Psychologically unhealthy
  * Irrelevant in a dynamic world
  * Preempts question of value

### Monopoly
* "There are businesses that are perfectly competitive and there are monopolies. There are very few businesses that aren't one or the other."
* ^ The margin between these two types of businesses is perceived as small, but it's actually large.
* Monopolies try to not look like monopolies
* Non-monopolies try to look like monopolies
* Pros
  * Incentive to innovate
  * Stable, long-term planning
  * Deeper project financing
  *
* Cons ???

### Narratives
* non-mons.: "we're in a narrow market"
  * relevant market: intersection of markets
  * "a British restaurant in Palo Alto" --> trying to make it seem unique/valuable
  * "sharing mobile social app"
  * "Stanford of North Dakota"
* mons: "we're in a huge market"
  * relevant market: union of markets
  * Google might describe itself as an advertising companies and then compare itself to advertising markets of various sizes

### How to Build a Monopoly
* Start small and monopolize
  * It's easier to dominate a small market than a large one
  * If you think your iniial market might be too big, it almost certainly is
  * Being a minow in an ocean is a bad place to be. You have a lot of competitors and you don't know who they are.

### Last Mover Advantage
* "You want to have a technology that is an order of magnitude better than the next-best thing"
* Economies of scale are monopoly-like
* The critical thing is to have a monopoly that lasts over time, not necessarily the first thing
* For a lot of companies, 3/4 of their value will render in 10 years from now
* Durability should be valued more. Currently, growth is valued most.

### Characteristics of Monopoly
* Network effects
* Proprietary technology
* Economies of Scale
* Brand

### History of Innovation
* Scientists capture 0% of X value, classically
* There are only two categories of companies in the past 250 years that have made money
  * Complex, vetically integrated monopolies. Difficult. Capital-intensive. Modern versions: Tesla, SpaceX. No single breakthrough; combination of things.
  * Software. Economies of scale, low marginal cost, high adoption rate.
* Common rationalizations:
  * "Scientists aren't interested in making money"
  * Is this designed to obscure the fact that the goal is to make Y% of X value?
  * "Software must just be worth more"
  * Obscures the fact that X and Y are independent variables

### Psychology of Competition
* We frequently think of losers as people who can't compete
* Mimetic preference, sheep-like, herd-like
* Competition as validation
  * "We go for things that lots of people are going for"
  * Education
  * Career
* People's identities get wrapped up in identities
* When you're competing, you get lost in comparing yourself to other people
* Maybe don't take the narrow door that everyone else is taking. Walk around the corner and take the vast gate.

* "Why will this company still be a monopoly 10-15 years from now?"
