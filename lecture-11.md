* Hiring the first ten people is kind of like hiring the first hundred people since they'll be hiring nine each (for example).
* How do you get the first ten people right?
  * Culture is more like gardening than architecture. Plant seeds, pull out weeds.
  * They were in such a crappy situation as a company that it acted as a filter. People had every reason not to join so if they did, they must have been passionate.
  * Early hires are people you've heard of/friends-of-friends who you have to work to convince to join.
  * Most were newly graduated/young because they were under-valued. Easier to convince, better value.
* Everyone you run into now might be a recruit 5-10 years from now.
  * Getting people consistently excited about what you're doing now will make your job easier later.
* How do you know that someone you're looking at is a quality person?
  * Ask people you know who know about things that you don't (e.g., what does a world-class financeperson look like?)
* Be very transparent about why it's an incredible opportunity and also the gory details-- you'll filter out the undercommitted people.
  * iPhone: You'll build something that your kids' kids will remember but you won't see your family for three years.
* Work with people as much as you can before hiring them. (specifically with the first 10 people-- week in advance)
* "Is this person the best at what they do among their friends?"
* "If you want to benchmark yourself and see how much of an impact you can really make, a startup is a great option"
  * --> this sort of story will often attract the best people
