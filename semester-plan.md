# Background
* "How to Start a Startup" is a class being taught at Stanford by Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, a prestigious startup accelerator.
* The class will feature a variety of guest speakers/lectureres who have tremendous experience/wisdom related to startups/tech.
* Universities across the world are organizing groups to watch the lectures together -> we're one of those.
* Viewing the lectures as a group provides us with the opportunity to discuss the topics afterward together. The course's assignments will be largely peer-reviewed, which means we'll need a group to review them.

# Process
* For now, we'll plan to meet in LWSN 1142 every Tuesday and Thursday @ 9:00pm. If we find that something else works better, we can adjust our plans.
* The lectures are ~50 mins each and will take place from now until December 4th, excluding breaks. From what I remember, our breaks align with Stanford's, so we shouldn't miss anything.
* Your level of involvement is totally up to you. No one is holding you accountable for showing up to every lecture or completing every assignment. I'd encourage you to put in whatever level of effort you can. I think you'll get a lot out of even coming only once a week, if that's all you can do. Following along with the assignments should prove to be really rewarding.
* I'll be making a Facebook group for the class so that the events can be open and we can keep everything in one place without annoying everyone in the Purdue Hackers group who isn't interested in the class.
