* Building something that servers your own needs is a common trick to avoid talking to users (but is bad)
* When Justin.tv started focusing on gaming, they began actually talking to users
* Twitch has an entire division of people within their company who are dedicated to talking to users
* Who you talk to isn't as important as what you ask

* 5 people I would talk to for a note-taking app:
  * Students who are good at notetaking
  * Students who are bad at notetaking
  * Professors-- are students focusing on the correct things?
  * Parents, potentially (if they're the people buying the products)
  * Universities-- would they buy this?

* People who aren't the users can still be critical to a product's success
  * Schools/parents might be the people buying, not the student

* Interview (X = take notes)
  * How do you do X today?
* Stay away from features/userflows
  * They'll tell you how to build a faster horse
* Trap: asking a user if they're excited about a specific feature
  * They will always say "yeah! great idea!"
  * Once you build, you'll find out that they may not necessarily actually use/like it
* If people pay, they're definitely interested
* People who are already using your service and are putting up with the existing problems probably aren't suggesting the most serious problems (since they have them and are okay with using the product anyway)
* Talking to people who don't use your product is useful too
