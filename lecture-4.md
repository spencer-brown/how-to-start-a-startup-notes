### Prerequisites
* Have a lot of time on yor hand

### Noob approach
1. Build product in secret
2. Exclusive press launch!
3. Wait for users
4. Buy users
5. Give up

### Problem
* What is it?
* How does it relate to you?
  * Can save a lot of time by analyzing the problem at the beginning and verifying that it's something you're passionate about
* Verify others have it

### Where to start
* Learn a lot. Become an expert.
  * She worked as a cleaner in order to learn about how cleaning companies functioned, etc.
* Identify customer segments.
* Storyboard ideal user experience.
  * Before writing any code.
  * How does the customer find out about you?
  * How do they learn more about you when they visit your site? What does the text say?

### What is v1?
* Minimum =viable= product
* Simple product positioning
  * "This does x, y, and z" --> single sentence
* This is not the hard part...

### First few users
* You!
* Your mom, friends, and co-workers
* Online communitiies, e.g. HN, reddit
* Local communities, e.g. mailing lists
* Niche influencers, e.g. mommy bloggers
* Cold calls and emails
* Press

### Customer feedback
* Support: very important
* Surveys: ok, interviews: better
  * avoid inquisition-type talks. she found success by taking people out for drinks.
* Quantitative: retention, ratings, net-promoter score
  * as you build over time, these things should go up
* Qualitative: ask why, why, why
* Beware of honesty curve
  * Friends-of-friends most honest for free product. Mom- not that honest. Randoms- hardly honest.
  * Paid product: mom < friends < friends-of-friends < randoms

### v1 feature creep
* Build fast, but optimize for now (not the future)
* Manual before automation
* Temporary brokennes > permanent paralysis
  * Don't worry about all of the edge cases. Figure out your core user base.
* Beware of frankenstein
  * Don't just build features that are requested. Get to the root of why someone wants a certain feature.

### 'S' is for 'stealth' and for 'stupid'
* Someone will steal your idea
* There is a first-move advantage
  * Assume that someone is going to follow after you and execute as hard as they can to catch up to you
* ...just launch it already

### Ready for a lot of users?
* Learn one channel at a time
  * You'll be tempted to try 5 at a time. Choose one for a week. If it works, continue until it caps-out. Then, move on to a different channel.
* Iterate working channels
* Revisit failed channels
  * Over time.
  * For example, at first, you might get beaten out by competitors in certain channels because of a lack of $. You might be able to do well later once you have $.
* key = creativity

### Types of growth
* Sticky
  * Trying to get users to come back and pay more or use more
  * Good experience wins
  * clv + retention cohort analysis important
    * 12 mo. CLV (customer lifetime value): how much revenue a customer brings you over 12 months
    * cohort = customer segment
    * x = time, y = %customers staying --> you want this to flatten out over time such that your churn becomes 0% (or close to it)
  * Repeat users buy more and more
* Viral
  * When people talk about you
  * WOW experience + good referral programs
  * Customer touch points
    * After signups, after leaving their home, etc.
  * Program mechanics
  * Referral conversion flow
    * Sometimes you need to sell them in a different manner
    * Mention what their friend has done on the site, maybe
* Paid
  * If you have $, you can buy growth
  * simple: clv > cac (customer aquisition cost)
  * advanced: clv(ijk) > cac(ijk)
  * payback time + sustainability
* key = sustainability

### THe art of pivoting
* Bad growth
* Bad retention
* Bad economics
