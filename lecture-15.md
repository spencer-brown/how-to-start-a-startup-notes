* You need to see management decisions through everyone's perspective, not just your own

* Do you demote or fire?
  * Issue with an exec who is awesome, but not as good as he needs to be for his position.
  * He has 1.5% equity, which makes demoting hard (weird dynamic between him and new head of sales)
* An excellent employee asks for a raise
  * Your perspective
    * You want to retain them
    * They have done great work, so it's "fair"
    * They will like you if you give them the raise
  * Their perspective
    * Shmoney dance
  * Every other employee's perspective
    * Unfair that I didn't get a raise
  * Cultural conclusion
    * Every employee has a fiduciary responsbility to their family to ask for a raise all the time
  * Right Answer
    * Formal performance evaluation process (need to be formal even though startups don't like that)
    * All the right inputs
    * Run as frequently as needed
    * No raises outside of the process
* Evaluting Sam's blog post
  * Until 2004, it made sense for options to disappear after 90 days of termination since it was accounted as an expense, prevented companies from going public
  * Employees feel handcuffed to their job
  * SV companies dilute at 6-8% per year when they are private for employee stock options
  * Should stock options end after 90 days or 10 years?
  * You don't want to screw over people who get fired (double-screw them, really, since you're already firing them)
* Toussaint
  * Born a slave
  * Most brutal form of African slavery
  * Vision: end slavery, take control of Haiti, and make it a first-class country
  1. Conquering the enemy
    * Soldiers' Perspective
      * Do we get to pillage? We like to pillage.
      * Can we kill them?
    * Culture
      * Toussaint wanted a first-class culture
      * He believed that Haitian culture was inferior to european culture and he believed that the slave culture was the most broken of them all
    * Solution: make them part of Toussaint's army (them = the guys who they're conquering)
  2. What do you do with the slave owners?
    * Toussaint's perspective
      * Economy is key to bieng a first world country and sugar is our top export by far, so productive plantations are critically important
      * No one has the expertise to run a sugar plantation or the business relationships required
      * The land is theirs fair and square
    * Solution
      * End slavery
      * Let slave owners keep their land
      * Require plantation owners to pay salaries to workers
      * Lower the taxes of the plantation owners, so that they could still make money
    * Results
      * Only successful slave revolt in human history
      * Let plantation owners keep their land
      * Total defeat of Napoleon
      * Booming economy + world-class culture
      * Under Toussaint, Haiti had more export income than the USA
      * => power of looking at situations from everyone's perspective
* Conclusion
  * You must consider the perspectives of the people who aren't in the room
  * They're the company, they're the culture
