### Team
* Cofounder relationships are some of the most important relationships in a company
* Choosing a founder is one of the most important decisions you'll make in the course of your startup's life
* It's better to have no founder than to have the wrong cofounder
* All of top 20 YC-funded companies have at least 2 cofounders- multiple founders > solo-founder
* Cofounders
  * Relentlessly resourceful
  * James Bond is the ideal cofounder
  * You want to know your cofounders for a while (ideally years)
  * Tough + calm is key
  * If you're not technical, you want a technical cofounder
* Try not to hire
  * Be proud of how much you can get done with a small number of employees
  * The cost of getting an early hire wrong is very high
* Get the best people
  * #1 piece of advice: join a rocketship (a company that's already working but not everyone has noticed it yet)
  * It's hard to recruit people. It can take up to a year. Part of why getting the product right is your first priority.
  * You should either be spending 0% or 25% of your time hiring.
  * Mediocre engineers do not build great companies
  * A single mediocre hire within the first 5 will ruin a company
  * "Will I bet the life of the company on this single hire?"
  * Best source for hiring: people you know
  * Look outside the Valley for hires
  * "How much does experience matter?"
    * Depends on the role. For most first hires, aptitude and belief in vision matter most. Most of the time you don't worry about experience at first.
  * Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?
    * If the answer to the three of these questions is yes, then you probably won't regret the hire. (Sam's experience).
    * If you don't know the answer to these questions already, you should work on a project for 1-2 days with the person.
    * Dig into past projects, not just brainteasers. Call references.
  * Also look for:
    * Good communication skills (KEY)
    * Manically determined
    * Pass the animal test
      * Want unstoppable people who are 'animals' at what they do
    * Would feel comfortable reporting to them
  * You should give 10% of your company to the first 10 employees (vesting)
  * People who are smart can almost always find a role in a company
* You've hired the best - now keep them around!
  * Give team all credit for good stuff, and yourself all credit for bad stuff
  * As a first time founder, you are likely to be a very bad manager. Try to overcompensate for that.
* Fire fast
  * Every first time founder waits too long
  * Better for employee, better for company
  * Fire people who create office politics and who create a negative environment (in addition to people who are bad at their job)
  * Don't fire for a few screwups. Fire when someone is doing everything wrong.
  * "You don't get to make all of the decisions, but you get to choose the decision-makers."
  * Will be painfully obvious

### Execution
* Company needs to see you as a maniacal execution machine
* The CEO has five jobs
  * Set the vision
  * Raise money
  * Evangelize
  * Hire and manage
  * Make sure the entire company executes
* Can you get it done?
  * Focus
    * What are you spending your time and money on?
    * What are the two or three most imporant things?
      * Need to focus on 2-3 things or you can't get stuff done
    * Say no. A lot.
    * Set overarching goals. Repeat them.
      * Most good founders have 2-3 primary goals that are known among the entire company. People will execute based on this.
    * Communicate.
    * Maintain growth and momentum
      * Should be suspicious of "we're not focused on growth right now"
      * Make sure you have the right metrics and focus on them
      * Common mistake: companies get distracted by their own PR
    * Work together in person
  * Intensity
    * Startups are all-consuming. You need to be willing to outwork your competitors.
    * Relentless operating rhythm
    * Obsession with execution quality
      * Frugal in the right places. Don't buy shitty computers.
    * Bias towars action
    * Every time you talk to them, they've gotten things done.
* Always keep growing!
  * After YC, people lose focus on growth
* Save vision speeches for when you're winning
* Sales fix everything. Focus on sales when momentum is sagging.
* People start disagreeing when momentum sags.
  * Solution: ask users what they want and do it.
* Set an operating rhythm to keep momentum
  * Shipping product
  * Launching new features
  * Reviewing/reporting metrics and milestones
* "The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time."
* Don't get down about competitors being in the press. Press articles are easier to write than good code.


* Random
  * Have vesting founder equity. YC doesn't invest in companies who don't have this.
  * Don't do remote cofounders
