Tyler Bosmeny - Sales

# The Reality
* It's you
* "Build or sell- nothing else matters"
* Pick a founder to own this
* Founder passion trumps sales experience!

# The Almighty Funnel
1. Prospecting
  * The mission
    * Find the innovators (2.5%)
    * It's a numbers game!
    * Reach out to >100 companies
    * Top 3 methods: your network, conferences, cold emails
2. Conversations
  * Do a lot of listening
  * Religious follow up
3. Closing
  * Closing traps: Redlines
    * Final step is to send them an agreement
    * YC has open-sourced their template! (and other deal documents!)
    * Don't quibble over minor points
  * Closing traps: 1 more feature
    * Usually a polite pass
    * Building it will not get you the sale!
    * Either
      * Sign a condiitional agreement
      * Wait to hear demand from more customers
  * Closing traps: Free Trials
    * Early on you need commitment, validation, and revenue
    * "Free trial" gets you none of these
    * Instead offer a 30-day cancellation period on an _annual contract_
4. Revenue
  * Looking Forward
    * 5 ways to build a business
    * Flea/Mice/Rabbits - marketing (lowly priced products)
    * Deer - inside sales
    * Elephants - field sales (highly priced products)

* Most important thing: when you get on the phone, remember to shutup
* Why'd you agree to take my call?
* What do you guys do today?
* What would your ideal solution look like?
* Goal should be to get to yes or no as quickly as possible
  * The maybes kill you



Michael Seibel
# 30 second pitch
* 3 sentences:
  * What does your company do?
    * Assume they know literally nothing
    * "Mom test"
  * How big is your market?
  * How much traction do you have?
    * "We launched in Jan. and we're growing 30% mo/mo, we have x users/customers/whatever"
    * If you can't do this, convince investor that you're moving really quickly

# 2 minute pitch
* This is for someone you're trying to convince of something
* Components
  * Clear 30 second pitch
  * Unique insight
    * 2 sentences. This is the 'aha' moment-- the reason that you're going to crush the competition
  * How you make money
    * One sentence
  * Team
    * Trying to do two things:
      * Call out anything you've done as a team that's particularly impressive (made investors money)
      * How many founders? How many are technical? How long have you known each other?
      * Want to hear that you're working full time and how you've met.
  * The big ask ($$$)
    * You have to figure out if this is a conversation that involves fundraising or not
    * Are you running on a convertible note or a safe? What's the cap on the safe?
    * Don't use jargon in other parts. Use jargon here.

# When to Fundraise
* When you are strong and they are weak
  * If investors are asking to give you money-- you're strong
* Have you created a plan to get to market without investment?
  * "If you wanna jump on, great, otherwise, we're moving"
* Always be able to show that you have a fully committed team that's moving fast
  * That's your advantage if you aren't launched/growing

# How to set up investor meetings
* Warm introductions (pref. from another entrepreneur or previous investor)
  * Past investors you've talked to but haven't invested are kryptonite
* Think Parallel
  * Sprint, not a marathon. Schedule all of your meetings in the same week.
  * Schedule in 3 weeks. Signals that you're building and not desperate
* 1 Team Member
  * 1 person should be invested in fundraising full-time


Investor Meetings

* Avoid common mistakes
  * make sure the listener understands what you're working on
  * know your numbers!
  * For market size ideally build bottom up analysis
  * You should understand something that is counterintuitive
* Hallmarks of a good pitch
  * Capture interest, told an interesting story, engage with the listener
  * Demonstrate insights and command of the market, passionate not dismissive
* After the meeting
  * Follow up (anything but a check is a "No")
  * Work on creating deal heat (supply/demand)
  * Do diligence on the investors
  * Know when to stop (addicted to fundraising)
  * Build your company
