# Four key areas to focus on:
1. Idea
  * Pivots are almost always into something that the founder's wanted, not just a random idea.
  * Ideas DO matter.
  * You need to build a business that's difficult to replicate.
  * The idea comes -before- the startup.
  * The company should feel like an important mission.
    * People outside of the company are more likely to help.
    * Otherwise, it's hard to rally a passionate team to work for you.
  * Truly good ideas don't seem like they're worth stealing.
  * Ideas don't need to seem like huge ideas. They need to take over a small part of the market and have potential to expand from there.
  * Need a market that's going to be big in 10 years.
    * Growth rate of market more important than current size.
    * Customers are more desperate. They'll put up with a less-developed product.
  * "Why now?"
  * Building a product that fixes a problem you have gives you a huge advantage.
  * If you can learn to think about the market first, you'll have a huge leg-up.
2. Product
  * Product includes anything your customers interact with related to what you've built for them.
  * Great idea --> great product --> great company.
  * In early days of startup, should be spending all time on computer or talking to customers.
  * Step 1 is building something users love.
  * Key advice: build something that a small number of users love. Easier to expand than a lot of users kind of like.
    * ^^^ this is the only thing you should care about until you have it.
    * You'll know this is working when you get a lot of growth from word-of-mouth.
  * Product before growth. A great product is long-term growth-hacking.
  * It takes some level of fanaticism to make a great product.
  * Get users manually. Don't use ad-words. Hand-pick them.
  * Cycle between Product decisions -> Show it to users -> User feedback (What do they like? What would they pay for? What would make them recommend it?)
    * Companies that have this feedback loop the tightest are the ones that succeed.
  * Metrics: focus on growth
    * Total registrations
    * Active users
    * Activity levels
    * ...
3. Team
4. Execution

* Only start a startup if you are passionate about a problem and think that starting a company is the best way to fix it.
* While you are a student:
  * Think about new ideas
  * Meet potential co-founders
* Few startups die from competition. Most fail from not making something that users love.
