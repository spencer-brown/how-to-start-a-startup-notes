### Retention
* If your days from acquisition (x) vs. % active monthly (y) is asymptotic to the x axis, you have a viable business for some subset of users
* Dimensional reasoning:
  * look at dimensions involved in a problem
  * then try to figure out how to get the numbers you want from those
  * How many people are using the internet? --> can figure out an approximation for FB's userbase from that
* Retention is the single most important thing for growth

### Operating for growth
* If you're a startup, you shouldn't have a growth team
  * The whole company should be the growth team. The CEO should be leading your growth and setting the North Star.
  * Monthly active users was FB's metric
  * MAU isn't the right metric for everyone. You need some metric though.
    * Once you get to a certain scale, this is key.
    * You lose control and only have influence.
    * People should have it in their heads that your chosen metric is their first priority.
* Marginal user/Magic Moment
  * eBay: don't show signup page after searching. Show it when purchasing.
    * Gives users a magic moment when they search (seeing the items) that gets them psyched about buying.
  * Facebook's magic moment- showing people their friends
* Power users aren't your focus for growth
  * Marginal users are your focus for growth
  * Power users are your focus for an awesome product
* Key: what is your North Star?
  * Most metrics are fairly similar/correlated- choose what feels best for you.

### Facebook growth
* Built slowly to prepare for rapid growth internationally
  * Built out a way for the community to translate themselves
* Building something for what exists today is a common mistake. They built for the future.

### Tactics
* Virality
  * Viral Loop by Adam L. Penenberg
    * Goes through a lot of case studies of companies that have succeeded through viral marketing
  * On Advertising by Ogilvy
  * Think about virality in terms of three things: (Sean Parker's model)
    * Payload- how many people can you hit with a single blast?
    * Frequency- how many times can you hit them?
    * Conversion rate- how many people convert?
  * Hotmail: attached a note to each email about Hotmail. Low payload, high frequency, high conversion rate
  * Paypal: low payload, low frequency, high conversion rate
  * Anything you can do to remove friction from the registration flow is good
  * Be careful to not send the same message too much- becomes ineffective
  * Other model of virality: from Uber growth team
    * import -> send -> how many people -> how many click -> how many signup -> import... (circular)
    * if you multiply these #s and %s, you get a k-factor
* SEO
  * Keyword research
    * Need to figure out what's getting searched. "Cocktail recipes," "cocktail mixes," "drink recipes"?
    * Google AdWords keywords tools is the best tool
    * Next thing: links
      * Covered online
* ESPN
  * Email, SMS, push notification
  * Email: watch for feedback from emails. Don't abuse. Will get blocked.
  * You must get them delivered. Focus on long-term. Watch out for getting blocked or users opting out.
  * What are you sending users?
    * Brand-new users and 3-year users don't need the same emails/messages.
    * Trigger-based ESPN
* SEM
* Affiliates/referral programs

* "A good plan violently executed today is better than a great plan executed tomorrow"
